…todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: Hoang Phat Nguyen - lazybee27102@gmail.com

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

The following functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can successfully add and remove items from the todo list
* [ ] User can tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [ ] User can persist todo items and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following optional features are implemented:

* [ ] Persist the todo items [into SQLiteinstead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](using RecyclerView with CustomAdapter and ViewHolder)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (items can be change to be done or not yet)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment] instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [ ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- Use RecyclerView with StaggeredGridLayoutManager and customize the Adapter with RecyclerView.ViewHolder pattern
- Every note can have style 'strikethrough' to ensure they have been done by User

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
